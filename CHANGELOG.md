# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

Note:

A lot of differences are uncertain.

## [3.8.1] - 2025-007-011@009.055 PM

- Remove PowerShell version detection functions
  - Deleted the PowershellVersionDetails struct and the Get_powershell_version function, including the embedded PowerShell script and related JSON parsing. This streamlines the code by removing PowerShell version detection logic that is no longer needed.

## [3.8.0] - 2025-007-011@009.046 PM

- Add PowerShell version detection utility
  - Introduces Get_powershell_version, which runs a PowerShell script to detect version details and feature support, returning a structured PowershellVersionDetails object. This helps determine PowerShell capabilities at runtime for improved compatibility handling.

## [3.7.0] - 2025-007-011@010.024 AM

- Add function to restart Windows File Explorer
  - Introduces Restart_file_explorer, which uses PowerShell commands to stop and restart explorer.exe, and waits for the process to relaunch. This utility aids in programmatically refreshing the Windows desktop environment.

## [3.6.0] - 2025-007-010@003.041 PM

- Add function to get primary IPv4 address
  - Introduces Get_primary_ipv4_address, which selects the most appropriate local IPv4 address by prioritizing preferred network interfaces and filtering out virtual, loopback, and irrelevant interfaces. Helper functions for extracting IPv4 addresses and checking excluded interface names are also included.

## [3.5.1] - 2025-007-010@003.035 PM

- Refactor JAVA_HOME setting in Install_Java
  - Replaces direct PowerShell command with a call to Set_system_environment_variable for setting JAVA_HOME. This improves code maintainability and centralizes environment variable management.

## [3.5.0] - 2025-007-010@003.031 PM

- Add function to set system environment variable
  - Introduces Set_system_environment_variable, which sets a system-wide environment variable in the Windows registry and broadcasts the change so that other processes recognize the update. Includes error handling and status messages for each step.

## [3.4.1] - 2025-007-009@007.049 PM

- Updated Topological_sort to sort nodes with the same precedence alphabetically, ensuring deterministic output. This affects both Topological_sort and Reverse_topological_sort, improving consistency for repeated runs with the same input graph.

## [3.4.0] - 2025-007-009@007.041 PM

- Added math_functions.
  - Added Topological_sort. Topological_sort performs a topological sort on a DAG using Kahn's algorithm. Returns the ordered list of tasks, or an error if a cycle is detected.
  - Reverse_topological_sort performs a topological sort and returns the reversed order. Useful for teardown operations or viewing leaf-to-root dependencies.

## [3.3.4] - 2025-007-007@006.020 PM

- Add_to_path's code updated.

## [3.3.3] - 2025-007-007@003.046 PM

- Added Expand_windows_env. Expand_windows_env expands environment variables using the Windows API. For example, %SystemRoot% becomes C:\Windows. Add_to_path now uses Expand_windows_env, instead of os.ExpandEnv.

## [3.3.2] - 2025-007-007@011.032 AM

- Add_to_path now prints fmt.Printf("üìù New PATH to be written:\n%s\n", path to be written.

## [3.3.1] - 2025-007-007@010.049 AM

### Improved
- Updated Add_to_path:
  - Now rewrites the entire PATH with fully expanded, deduplicated, and normalized entries.
  - Removes duplicates even if they differ by case, trailing slashes, or use of environment variables (e.g., `%SystemRoot%`).
  - Stores only literal absolute paths, eliminating any `%VAR%` references in PATH.

## [3.3.0] - 2025-007-007@008.056 AM

- Updated Add_to_path/Remove_from_path to expand environment variables before comparing.

## [3.2.1] - 2025-007-006@003.039 PM

- Update date_time_functions to use "github.com/PeterCullenBurbery/go_functions_002/v3/system_management_functions" instead of "github.com/PeterCullenBurbery/go_functions_002/v2/system_management_functions".

## [3.2.0] - 2025-007-005@007.048 PM

- Updated Install_Java. Install_Java now sets JAVA_HOME to `C:\Program Files\Eclipse Adoptium\jdk-21.0.6.7-hotspot` using ```(`[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("JAVA_HOME", "%s", "Machine")`, java_home)```.
